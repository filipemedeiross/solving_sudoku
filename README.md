<h1>SOLVING SUDOKU BY SEARCH FOR CSP</h1>

## Implementing the Sudoku

The sudoku was implemented using the numpy library for the game logic and the pygame library for the interface. The sudoku grid is generated in an automated way through the search strategy with backtracking that initially fills it completely and later clears the positions checking through a solver, which also uses regular search with backtracking, if the sudoku remains with a unique solution (by default 41 clues are displayed and the class with the initial grid does not contain the game instance response).

The game has three screens explained below:

![Home Screen](https://github.com/filipemedeiross/solving_sudoku_by_search_for_csp/blob/main/examples/home_screen.jpeg?raw=true)

The home screen displays the sudoku initial grid and the **Play** button that launches the game when clicked. It also has an **i** button that takes you to the creator's github profile.

When starting the game, it displays the time count while allowing the user to complete the sudoku. The buttons above, from left to right respectively, allow the user to return to the home screen, load a new game, restart the current game, undo moves in the most recent order, and mark moves as right or wrong.

![Winner Screen](https://github.com/filipemedeiross/solving_sudoku_by_search_for_csp/blob/main/examples/winner_screen.jpeg?raw=true)

When you win the game, time is paused and interaction with the sudoku grid and related functions is disabled. The function to return to the home screen and load a new game remains active.

## Modeling Sudoku with Integer Programming

Entry:

$$
I=\set{0, 1, \ldots, 8}
$$

$$
J=\set{0, 1, \ldots, 8}
$$

$$
K=\set{1, 2, \ldots, 9}
$$

$$
C= \set{(i, j, k), \ldots },   i \in I, j \in J, k \in K
$$

Decision Variables: represents whether row i column j is filled with the value k.

$$
x_{ijk},   i \in I, j \in J, k \in K
$$

Objective Function:

$$
Min \space {Z=0}
$$

Subject to:

$$
\sum\limits_{k=1}^{9}x_{ijk}=1,   \forall i \in I, \forall j \in J
$$

$$
x_{ijk} = 1,   \forall (i, j, k) \in C, k>0
$$

$$
\sum\limits_{j=0}^{8}x_{ijk}=1,   \forall i \in I, \forall k \in K
$$

$$
\sum\limits_{i=0}^{8}x_{ijk}=1,   \forall j \in J, \forall k \in K
$$

$$
\sum\limits_{i=m}^{m+2}\sum\limits_{j=n}^{n+2}x_{ijk}=1,   m \in \set{0, 3, 6}, n \in \set{0, 3, 6}, \forall k \in K
$$

$$
x_{ijk} \in \set{0, 1}, \forall i \in I, \forall j \in J, \forall k \in K
$$

## Solvers Benchmark

The solvers benchmark can be seen from `tests/solvers_benchmarks.ipynb` and tested regular backtracking, search for constraint satisfaction problems, and integer linear programming. It was observed that the regular search method with backtracking is very efficient for easier sudoku instances, however it becomes unfeasible to solve more complex instances because the execution time increases considerably.

Besides solving sudoku through integer linear programming has shown to be a good option, the search method for constraint satisfaction problems proves to be the most suitable. In this search strategy, the resolution time remains below two tenths of a second for the most difficult instance in the game.

## Resolution Strategy Implemented in the Game

The game interface has the option to mark the fillings performed as right or wrong. The solution is loaded with each new instance of the game through a different solver than the one used in the sudoku generator, which performs a pre-processing that uses the propagation of inferences through a simple node consistency and the AC-3 algorithm and the search with backtracking to csp (contained in the `solver_backtracking_for_csp.py` submodule of the `solvers` subpackage).

The AllDifferent constraints are transformed into binary constraints to allow the application of the AC-3 algorithm, which in most cases is sufficient to reduce the domains of the variables to 1 and find the solution, in which case the backtracking search for csp only assigns the NxN variables once (with N=9).

When finding the solution, it is stored in a distinct attribute of the game grid.
